T20 Cricket Analytics Dashboard

Domain: Sports Analytics
Tools: Power BI, Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
This project focuses on analyzing T20 cricket match data to provide actionable insights for players, teams, and analysts. The objective is to extract meaningful patterns and create an interactive dashboard for visualization.

The dataset underwent preprocessing in Python using Pandas to handle missing values, normalize data, and create derived metrics like batting strike rates and bowling economies. The cleaned data was then imported into Power BI to design an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard includes features such as:

Player Performance Analysis: Batting strike rates and bowling economies.
Match Insights: Key statistics like team scores, run rates, and partnerships.
Dynamic Filtering: Year, team, and player-specific insights.
This project leverages advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive view of T20 cricket performance.
